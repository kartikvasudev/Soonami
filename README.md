# Soonami

Soonami is a dynamic application that fetches data about recent earthquakes from the USGS API and updates the application. The app uses AsyncLoader for handling fluctuations of screen orientation, Android's HTTPURLConnection to get data from the USGS API and then displays data on the List View. It also handles all the other cases(when there is no internet).
